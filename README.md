## 🧠 About

I’m a Senior / Lead Web3 engineer with **8+ years of commercial experience**
building and leading production systems in **DeFi, DAO governance and Web3 infrastructure**.

I specialize in **end-to-end product ownership** — from architecture and smart contracts
to backend, frontend, CI/CD and team processes.

Worked on both **large closed-source commercial products** and **open-source Web3 infrastructure**.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- Treat smart contracts as **critical infrastructure**
- Prefer explicit, maintainable architectures
- Optimize for long-term scalability, not quick hacks
- Strong processes and tooling scale teams better than heroics
